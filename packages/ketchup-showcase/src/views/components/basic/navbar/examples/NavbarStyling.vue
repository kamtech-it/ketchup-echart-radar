        >The appearance of the component can be customized using themes, more
        specifically you can set the nav bar's height, the color of slots and
        the nav bar's background color.<br />
        The content will be colored dynamically with black or white, depending
        on the contrast with the background.<br />
        There are 2 different styles available for the nav bar component:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="code-word">- standard</span>: this is the default look;
        <br />
        <span class="code-word">- short</span>: this style will feature a very
        compact nav bar, ideally with only a couple actions.
        <br />
