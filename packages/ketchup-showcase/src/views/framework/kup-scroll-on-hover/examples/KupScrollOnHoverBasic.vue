        Who didn't stumble, while surfing on the web, in a super big HTML
        element which needed to be scrolled, but the scrollbar was out of the
        viewport? So annoying.<br />
        This is the main purpose of
        <span class="code-word">KupScrollOnHover</span>, it lets you scroll an
        element horizontally by just hovering on its left and right edges.<br />It's
        also possible to scroll vertically.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'KupScrollOnHoverBasic',
  data() {
    return {};
  },
};
</script>
