        Any modern library's features should be usable from touch devices
        nowadays. In order to do so seamlessly, Ketchup makes use of an external
        library called <a href="https://interactjs.io/">Interactjs</a>, which
        offers a wide gamma of user interface actions utilities.<br />
        <span class="code-word">KupInteract</span> is a class which basically
        wraps Interactjs to let the application use it.
